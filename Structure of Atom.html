	An atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outer region of the atom, which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus.
	Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10-24 grams, which scientists define as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton.
	Each electron has a negative charge (-1) equal to the positive charge of a proton (+1).
	Neutrons are uncharged particles found within the nucleus.
</p>
<p>
	Neutral atoms of each element contain an equal number of protons and electrons.
	The number of protons determines an element’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another.
	The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess.
	Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s mass number.
	Since an element’s isotopes have slightly different mass numbers, the atomic mass is calculated by obtaining the mean of the mass numbers for its isotopes.

<p>
	Isotopes are atoms of the same element that contain an identical number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.
	Despite having different numbers of neutrons, isotopes of the same element have very similar physical properties.
	Some isotopes are unstable and will undergo radioactive decay to become other elements.
	The predictable half-life of different decaying isotopes allows scientists to date material based on its isotopic composition, such as with Carbon-14 dating.
