	Dimensional analysis is the process of converting between units.
	The International System of Units (SI) specifies a set of seven base units from which all other units of measurement are formed. Derived units are based on those seven base units.
	Unit analysis is a form of proportional reasoning where a given measurement can be multiplied by a known proportion or ratio to give a result having a different unit or dimension.
	Dimensional analysis involves using conversion factors, which are ratios of related physical quantities expressed in the desired units.

	Chemistry, along with other sciences and engineering, makes use of many different units.
	In mathematics and chemistry, a conversion factor is used to convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the relative amount.
	Units behave just like numbers in products and quotientsâ€”they can be multiplied and divided.

	Chemistry, along with other sciences and engineering, makes use of many different units. Some of the common ones include mass (ton, pounds, ounces, grains, grams); length (yard, feet, inches, meters); and energy (Joule, erg, kcal, eV). Since there are so many different units that can be used, it is necessary to be able to convert between the various units. To do this, one uses a conversion factor.

	In mathematics, specifically algebra, a conversion factor is used to convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the relative amount. To accomplish this, a ratio ( fraction ) is established that equals one (1). In the ratio, the conversion factor is a multiplier that, when applied to the original unit, converts the original unit into a new unit, by multiplication with the ratio.

	When doing dimensional analysis problems, follow this list of steps:
	<p>1.Identify the given (see previous concept for additional information).</p>
	<p>2.Identify conversion factors that will help you get from your original units to your desired unit.</p>
	<p>3.Set up your equation so that your undesired units cancel out to give you your desired units. A unit will cancel out if it appears in both the numerator and the denominator during the equation.</p>
	<p>4.Multiply through to get your final answer.</p>
