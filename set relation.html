	This topic “Relations and Functions” is a foundation or fundamental of algebra in mathematics. Relations and functions are two different words having different meaning mathematically. Many us you might be confused in their difference. We shall study both these concepts in detail here.

	Same as the relations which we have in our daily life, a kind of relations also exists in algebra. In daily life, relations are like brother and sister, friends, student and teacher and many more. In mathematics also we see some relations like a line is parallel or perpendicular to another, any one variable is greater or less than the another variable. Any Set A is subset of B, all these are examples of relations.

	One thing which we see in common while studying relations, that it required two different objects to link two different objects via relations.

	Understanding Relations requires basic knowledge of sets. A Set is a collection of well defined objects of particular kind. For Example a set of outcomes of dice, a set of English alphabet.

	Relation is always studied between two sets. If we have two non void (or null/empty) sets A and B then the relation R from set A to set B is represented by aRb, where a is the set of elements belonging to set A while b belongs to set B.

	Relation from a set A to a set B is the subset of the Cartesian product of A and B i.e. subset of A x B. Relation in other way can also be defined as an collection of ordered pairs (a, b) where a belongs to the elements from set A and b from set B and the relation is from A to B but not vice versa.

	Functions are the special class of relation or we can say that special types of relations are called as Functions. Function is one of the most important concepts in mathematics as every situation in real life are solved and analysed first by writing its mathematical equation or function.

	A function is like a machine which gives unique output for each input that is fed into it. But every machine is designed for certain defined inputs for e.g. a washing machine is designed for washing cloths and not the wood. Similarly the functions are defined for certain inputs which are called Functionsas its domain and corresponding outputs are called Range.

	For a relation from set A to set B i.e. aRb, all the elements of set A are called as the domain of the relation R while all the elements of set B are called as the co-domain of the relation R.

	Range is the set of all second elements from the ordered pairs (a, b) in the relation aRb.

	Domain of f = {a | a ∈ A, (a, f(a)) ∈ f }

	Range of f = {f (a) |a ∈ A, f(a) ∈ B, (a, f (a)) ∈ f}

	the domain of a functionFor the relation aRb, domain is considered as the input to relation R while the co-domain is the possible outputs and range is the actual output.

	Similarly for a function, f: A → B,  elements of set A are the inputs and B is the set of possible outputs. But the second elements of all ordered pair of f(A, B) will be the actual outputs.

	It should be noted that range is a subset of co-domain. If only the rule of function is given then the domain of the function is the set of those real numbers, where function is defined. For a continuous function, the interval from minimum to maximum value of a function gives the range.
