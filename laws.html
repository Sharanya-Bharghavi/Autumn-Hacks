	Newton's laws of motion are of fundamental importance in classical physics. Newton gave three laws connected with motion and are, popularly, known as Newtonâ€™s laws of motion.
</p>
<p>
<font color=blue size="5">First Law
<font color=black>
</p>
<p>
	Everybody continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled by some external force to change that state.
</p>
<p>
<font color=blue size="5">Second law
<font color=black>
</p>
<p>
	The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the impressed force and takes place in the direction of the force.
	<p>

     So, F= dp/dt
</p>
    <p> This results force acting a body F is equal to the mass of the body m times acceleration of the body a.
</p>
     So, F = ma
 </p>
 <p>

<font color=black>
</p>
 <p>
 	The first two laws relate to the type of motion of a system that results from a given set of forces. The third law studies the basic nature of all forces i.e. they act in action - reaction pair.
